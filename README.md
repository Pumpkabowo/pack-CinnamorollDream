# pack-CinnamorollDream by Pumpkabowo
CinnamorollDream is a cozy, pastel-themed RuneLite resource pack inspired by the adorable Sanrio character, Cinnamoroll. This is my first attempt at creating custom OSRS visuals, blending soft aesthetics with dreamy UI elements to make the gameplay feel extra sweet and comforting, focusing on the color blue! 

As mentioned, this is my first upload of the pack, and itâ€™s just the beginning! Iâ€™ll be updating and tweaking things over time as I learn more and continue to refine the theme. Thank you for checking it out and being part of this cozy little project! ðŸ’«


This pack is only for resizeable mode as of now. This includes Cinna themed:
- Chatbox
- Minimap
- Inventory & Tab
- Bank
